    <h3>Romelito</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Romel Patino. I'm 39 years old, and I'm from Ecuador. </p>
    <p>I love technology, and I am really excited to be taking this class because I know it will help me develop my skills and increase my knowledge. </p>
    <p>I'm happily married and the father of two daughters. One funny fact is that my oldest daughter and I are starting college at the same time.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love to learn new things and watch soccer.</p>
